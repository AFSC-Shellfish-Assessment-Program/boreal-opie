# Scripts
The following brief descriptions serve as a guide to the different scripts used in the analysis.

*BCS Prevalence.r* -- Processes visual bitter crab syndrome (BCS) detection data from the bottom trawl survey for use in the borealization index.

*borealization_attribution_resampling.R* -- Calculates preindustrial and historical probabilities for estimation the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR).

*borealization_effects.R* -- Evaluates the statistical relationship between southeast Bering Sea borealization and snow crab abundance.

*borealization_effects_additional_model_evaluation.R* -- Conducts model evaluation presented in Extended Data Figs. 2 & 7.

*borealization_pdfs.R* -- Calculates probability densities for borealization index at different levels of North Pacific warming.

*bottom_temp_imputation.R* -- Imputes missing 2020 bottom temperature values for model evaluation presented in Extended Data Fig. 2.

*bycatch_biomass_plot.R* -- Creates Extended Data Fig. 6.

*chla_processing.R* -- Processes phytoplankton size ratio data for inclusion in borealization index.

*DFA.R* -- Creates borealization index using a Dynamic Factor Analysis model.

*ERSST query.R* -- Creates Extended Data Fig. 1.

*estimate_bottom_temp.R* -- Uses multiple imputation to fill in missing station values for bottom temperature and corrects bottom temperature estimates for annual differences in seasonal timing of sampling.

*Figs.R* -- Creates Figs. 1 & 2.

*Groundfish_biomass.R* -- Processes groundfish data for inclusion in borealization index.

*ice_query.R* -- Processes ERA5 ice cover data for inclusion in borealization index.

*Imm_Area.R* -- Calculates core range for immature snow crab.

*imputed_male_female_abundance_Fig1.R* -- Uses multiple imputation to estimate missing station values for snow crab abundance for plotting in Fig. 1 and use in "borealization_effects.R".

*sst_borealization.R* -- Creates Bayesian operating model of SST-borealization index relationship for use in attribution.

*stan_utils.R* -- Runs diagnostics for Bayesian regression models.

*zooplankton_processing.R* -- Processes *Calanus* and *Pseudocalanus* data for inclusion in borealization index.
